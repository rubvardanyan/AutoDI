### Code style

Normal .NET coding guidelines apply.

### Dependencies

Additional dependencies should only be added in the the [Examples](/Examples). 

### Unit tests

Make sure to run all unit tests before creating a pull request.
Where aplicable please add unit tests. PR that simply improve the unit test coverage are happily accepted.

### Environment

AutoDI uses the latest C# and Visual Studio. If you are experiencing compile issue please verify that you are using the latest.

## Contributing process

 * If you have a feature request please open a new issue so we can discuss it.
 * If you have questions or problems, consider posting them in the [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/AutoDIContainer/Lobby).
 * If there is an existing issue marked [Help wanted](/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted") feel free to comment so others know you are working on it. If it has been longer than a week, please post an additional comment indicating if you are still working on the issue or not so others know if they should work on it. If an issue goes longer than a week without a response, it may be updated so others can work on it.
 
### Submitting a Pull Request

 * Fork the repository
 * Create a branch named specific to the feature. You will need to create a separate branch for each issue you fix.
 * In the branch you do work specific to the feature.
 * Keep the changes specific to the bug or feature you are working on
 * Run the unit tests - AppVeyor will do this as well when you submit a PR. PRs will not be accepted until all of the unit tests pass.
 * Create a PR from your branch back to the master branch. Make sure to reference the issue you are addressing.

### Respond to feedback on pull request

If you would like feedback on work in progress, feel free to submit a PR prefixed with "WIP" so it is clear the work is not finished.
After a code review there may be some desired changes. This is simply ot try and maintain a nice cohesive code base.
